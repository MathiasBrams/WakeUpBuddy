# WakeUpBuddy

Mobile app where you can set an alarm to wake up, but in order to turn it off you have to play a game first.

App made in Flutter/Dart with social sign-ups and user tracking in Firebase.

The game is made with Unity/C# and imported into the app with a Flutter pub.dev package called UnityLibrary.

The game won't work because files in the unity library exceeds the 100MB individual Github limit, so they were set in the .gitignore.
